      "author": "Junkybooks",
      "description": "So you start the day full of enthusiasm. You're excited about a new piece of creative work and itching to put your ideas into action. Firing up your computer, the familiar stream of e-mails pours into your inbox, burying the ones you didn't get round to replying to yesterday. Scanning through the list, your heart sinks - two of them look as though they require urgent action. You hit 'reply' and start typing a response to one of them... 20 minutes later you 'come round' and realise you've got sucked into the e-mail zone and have been sidetracked by interesting links sent by friends, as well as writing replies about issues that aren't a priority for you. You minimize the email window and get back to your project...",

      "title": "An Introduction To The Enneagram",
      "author": "Junkybooks",
      "description": "I was introduced to the Enneagram in 1997, since when I have found it a powerful and practical tool, in my own life and relationships, and in my work - originally as a psychotherapist and now also as a business coach and consultant. The Enneagram system is not confined to what modern psychology regards as the 'personality' - it includes the whole of human nature, mental, emotional and physical - but I will limit this brief introduction to the personality types and how they can help you in your personal and professional development.",

      "title": "15 Questions About Online Advertising",
      "author": "Junkybooks",
      "description": "The real question of course is: Does online advertising work? Isn't it time that somebody tried to deconstruct all this bul****t? Unfortunately, it's impossible to give a simple answer to this apparently straightforward question.? For starters, this is not a single question, but at least three different ones. The right question to ask would be: for whom does online advertising work? Do banner ads, what we once called interactive advertising and now call display ads because nobody clicks on them, and much less interacts with them, work for publishers? Do they work for advertisers? Or do they just work for the middlemen based in Silicon Valley?",
